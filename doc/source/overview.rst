Motivations
-----------

Complete maps of brains detailing how the billions of 
neurons in a brain connect with each other (connectomics) 
are now emerging as a valuable tool in neuroscience. Such 
maps will provide insight into the ways in which brains 
store and process information at low energies as well as 
reveal how brains vary from each other as well as in 
development, aging, and disease.
